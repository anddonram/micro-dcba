Version 1.0 beta (20/07/2015):
- Defined a binary format for input files, latest revision in 16-09-2014.
- Input module for reading binary files with format of revision 16-09-2014.
- Output module for generating CSV files from the simulations.
- Added the new options to the command line syntax, such as the cycles (transition steps for a cycle).
- Attached a branch of pLinguaCore to generate binary files from .pli.
- Refined verbosity levels.
- Fixed some problems with BINV algorithm for generating random binomial variates.
- Fixed a problem when allocating space for rule applications (not enough space was given).
- The GPU simulator for PDP systems was extended and analysed in the paper:
